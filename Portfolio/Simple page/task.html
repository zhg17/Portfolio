<h5>Description</h5>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning">Before starting the project, please install <em>Node.js</em> from <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the official website</a> or make sure it is already installed on your computer. It is used for checking that you're on the right track in the project. </div></p>

<p>In the first stage, you need to create a simple web page. It should have the following HTML elements: top-level heading, two second-level headings, at least one paragraph of text, and at least two images.</p>

<p><div class="alert alert-primary">We are not trying to collect or otherwise use any personal information about the users. Feel free to use random data in this project instead of your personal information.</div><br>
<br>
By following <a target="_blank" href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/467516/images.zip" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this link</a>, you can download the images used in the web page from the example below.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<ol>
	<li>Come up with a header for your future site and wrap it in a proper tag for a first-level heading.</li>
	<li>Create a second-level heading with the text "About me".</li>
	<li>Place your photo or any image that will represent you.</li>
	<li>Put at least one paragraph of text on the site: this will be the personal biography section.</li>
	<li>Create another second-level heading with the text "Portfolio".</li>
	<li>Place at least one image that will represent your work experience and achievements.</li>
	<li>Put a title or a project name under each image so that they don't appear out of context.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>Here is what your simple page is supposed to look like at the end of the stage implementation:</p>
