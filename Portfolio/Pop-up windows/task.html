<p>Screenshots of your portfolio projects and their names probably do not convey the whole essence of your work. Let's create pop-ups with more detailed information about your projects and work experience. For example, you can specify what technologies you used to create each project, how exactly they were made, and where they can be found.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<ol>
    <li>In front of each project/achievement, add a button that will trigger a pop-up window when pressed. Specify the <code class="java">open-window</code> class for the buttons. </li>
    <li>In an HTML file, create a pop-up template. Add the <code class="java">window</code><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>class to the tag in which your window will be wrapped.</li>
    <li>Write a script so that the pop-up window with the necessary information appears when the button is pressed.</li>
    <li>Complete your script so that the window can close.</li>
    <li>Write styles for your new elements.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>Here is an example of a pop-up window:</p>
