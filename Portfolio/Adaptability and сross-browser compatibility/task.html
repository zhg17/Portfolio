<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Finally, let's focus on the adaptability and cross-browser compatibility of your website.</p>

<p>At the moment, the navigation bar of your site is displayed okay on computers and laptops, but it does not look great on tablets and phones. Let's make a hamburger menu for those visitors who are using mobile devices. The <strong>hamburger menu</strong> refers to a type of menu that unfolds after clicking the button with three bars:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="94" src="https://ucarecdn.com/8b15eddc-6ec1-4124-b85b-fa0ab31736af/-/crop/578x545/666,0/-/preview/" width="100"></p>

<p>Such appearance does remind you of a hamburger a little, right? You've probably seen menus of this type a hundred times before.</p>

<p>Don't forget to test how your menu is displayed on devices with different screen sizes. At the same time, make sure that the menu and other elements of your site display well on different devices and browsers.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<ol>
	<li>In the HTML file, create an element with an icon that will open the navigation menu when pressed on mobile devices.</li>
	<li>Use CSS to make this icon appear on your site when you view it on devices with smaller screen sizes. The <code class="java">@media</code> rule and the <code class="java">display</code> or <code class="java">visibility</code> property will help you do this.</li>
	<li>Create the menu itself. Set the <code class="java">hamburger</code> class to the tag that wraps the menu elements.</li>
	<li>Specify the properties for the menu so that it is located where you want it.</li>
	<li>Write a script so that when you click the menu icon, it opens and the icon appearance changes (see the examples).</li>
	<li>Complete your program so that the menu closes when you click the icon.</li>
	<li>Make sure that other elements of your site also display okay on different devices and in different browsers. If necessary, adjust your code.</li>
</ol>
